            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>With the exception of some undefeated streaks at the beginning of seasons, the percentages usually hang in the 55 – 75% range, While attendance fluctuates between 6,000 to 9,000. The results do not seem to correlate to past performance. The high attendance outliers are the USL Championship game and rivalry games with FC Cincinnati (the increase is attributed to hype of the rivalry and travelling FCC supporters). Also there are a couple of outliers at 100% win rate but the attendance is at the low end of the graph. These games were played at the beginning of the season when the weather was colder.  High profile games, local rivalries and weather appear to be more of impact than the team’s performance. Also, weekend games versus weekday games were another factor that was not seen in these graphs.</p>
