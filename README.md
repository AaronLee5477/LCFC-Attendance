Welcome to my Code Louisville Python project.

The question I want to examine is "Does the Louisville City Football Club's on-field performance affect the attendance of their home matches."

I created an Excel spreadsheet of match results from the USL (United Soccer League) website, including opponents, scores, records and attendance numbers for the entire 2017 season and the first part of the 2018 season. In order to start work on my project, I discontinued tracking their performance after their June 16th home match. In this project, I used SQLite to create two new columns of data: The current win percentages (Wins vs Total matches) and nonloss percentages (Wins & Draws vs Total matches). 

All files that were used in the presentation are available in this repository. To view my source files, you will need to install SQLite and Anaconda. With Jupyter Notebook, you will need the Sqlite3, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries. Thank you for stopping by!!
