Welcome to my Code Louisville Python project.

The question I want to examine is "Does the Louisville City Football Club's on-field performance affect the attendance of their home matches."

I created an Excel spreadsheet of match results from the USL (United Soccer League) website, including opponents, scores, records and attendance numbers for the entire 2017 season and the first part of the 2018 season. In order to start work on my project, I discontinued tracking their performance after their June 16th home match. In this project, I will use SQLite to create two new columns of data: The current win percentages (Wins vs Total matches) and nonloss percentages (Wins & Draws vs Total matches). I chose to present this in the form of a 4-page website. It includes a step-by-step display including image and code clips from SQLite and Jupyter Notebook. I used Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook for my final data analsis representation.

I am using the GitHub Pages hosting feature to present my work.

You can move through the presentation using the navigational buttons at the bottom of each page, or you can jump directly to whatever page you desire using the buttons at the top.

All files that are mentioned in the presentation are available in this repository. Thank you for stopping by!!
