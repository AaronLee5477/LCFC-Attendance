            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Since its inaugural season in 2015, the Louisville City Football Club (LCFC) has consistently been in the Top 3 in average attendance in the United Soccer League (USL).  LCFC has maintained a winning record for its first three full seasons. Also, all they advanced to the Eastern Conference Final for all three seasons, and won the USL Cup in 2017. </p>

          <h1>My Question</h1>
          <p>Does Louisville City’s performance affect immediate attendance? To find out, I pulled the 2017 and 2018 (up to June 16th) attendance and match results from USL’s website to determine this. I looked at both their win percentage  and their non-losses (wins and draws) percentage to see if there is any correlation? </p>
